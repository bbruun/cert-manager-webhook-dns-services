# ACME webhook for DNS.Services

This is a webhook for [Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io) for the DNS hosting service [DNS.Services](https://dns.services).

This is the k8s version of the [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) DNS-01 provider script [dns_dnsservices.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/blob/master/dnsapi/dns_dnsservices.sh) that is released but is still undergoing "initial multi zone testing".

# Installation

As of this release the webhook is still in testing phase, so the installation is manual.

## First Install Helm or Kubectl

There are 2 ways to install Cert Manager - helm or kubectl.
There is currently only only one way to install this webhook - kubectl.

So make sure you have both [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed as you'll need at least one of them.
## Installing Cert Manager

Follow the Cert Manager installation guide for [helm]](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/helm/) or [kubectl](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/) eg 

```shell
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io

helm repo update

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.9.1/cert-manager.crds.yaml

helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.10.0 \
  --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-self-check-nameservers=195.242.131.6:53}'
```

Note: The `--dns01-self-check-nameservers` is mostly meant for split horizon DNS zones, but can possibly help decrease the time it takes for cert-manager to do the check that the \_acme-challange TXT record has been created and propagated on DNS.Services. The IP is for ns1.dns.services
[Have alook at the documentation for the `--dns01-self-check-nameservers`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/release-notes-0.4/)

## Install this DNS.Services Webhook

As of this alpha release most of the building and testing is done internally with my own registry, but I'll try to keep the following up2date

`docker.io/bbruun/dns-services-webhook:latest`

This means that you 
1. need to clone this repo
2. change to the `dns-services-webhook/deploy` directory
3. run ` helm install dns-services-webhook dns-services-webhook --namespace cert-manager`

## Configuration

You need to setup a Issuer or ClusterIssuer for CM to work.


Example: 
```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencryptOfYourChoice
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: your@example.com
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-account-key
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        webhook:
          config:
            Email: your@example.com
            Password: yourDNSServicesAPIPassword
            Host: https://dns.services/api
          groupName: dns.services.cert-manager.io
          solverName: dns.services.cert-manager.io
```
The `Issuer` is just like the above, but is `kind: Issuer` and needs to be applied to the `cert-manager` namespace as it is not a ClusterIssuer.

## Configuring a certificate

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: name-of-certificate
spec:
  secretName: your-secret-name-for-the-example.com-certificate
  commonName: example.com
  dnsNames:
  - example.com
  - '*.example.com'
  issuerRef:
    name: IssuerOrClusterIssuerName_eg_the_above_letsencryptOfYourChoice
    kind: ClusterIssuer
```

Apply this to the namespace where it is to be used


# Using it all

## Issue a certificate you use by your self in a secret

Create a Certificate as described above and add it the a namespace eg


```shell
kubectl -n awesomeNamespace apply -f <nameOfCertificateYamlFile>
```

After a couple minutes the secret `secretName` will be updated and you can use it as you like

## Using it with an Ingress Controller

Cert Manager needs some annotations on (all) your Ingress/IngressRoutes to be able to scan, issue and create the secret needed to use the certificate.

The annotataion is as follows:

```á»³aml
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: $INGRESS_CONTROLLER
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: NAME_OF_Issuer_OR_ClusterIssuer
```

Your INGRESS_CONTROLLER is eg `nginx` or `nginx-ingress` or `traefik` or .. which ever Ingress Controller you have/use.

# Developer and testing notes

Requirements:
* GIT
* Go 1.18+
* Docker or [podman](https://podman.io/) (a great alternative to Docker)
* A https://DNS.Services account
* a Kubernetes cluster you control

# Issues you may encounter

Besides all the issues for [Cert Manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues) it self then I've only observed 2

# Cert Managers CNAME issues

I've found that the default wildcard CNAME entry `*.example.com` pointing to the root zone A record makes Cert Manager loop and state the the _acme-challenge DNS record has not yet been propergated.
If you add a A record named `lb.example.com` that is your "default" A record and setup the wildcard CNAME `*.example.com` then it works.

This seems to be a somewhat wellknown issue with Cert Manager and this is not the only DNS provider where **Cert Manager has this issue**.

## Issue #1: DNS resolution

When Cert Manager creates a certificate it does internal DNS resolution for the _acme-challenge.example.com CNAME entry.

If you happen to run into the logs for Cert Manager just stating something like the following:

`"error"="DNS record for \"subdom.example.com\" not yet propagated"`

Then you need to edit the Cert Manager Deployment and add the above mentioned extraArgs (the last two below in the snippet) and do a restart of the cert-manager deployment so one of two ways to fix this:

### Fix manually - not helm upgradable afterwards

1. Edit the Deployment `kubectl -n cert-manager edit deployment cert-manager` and add the two --dns01... parameters
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - --v=2
        - --cluster-resource-namespace=$(POD_NAMESPACE)
        - --leader-election-namespace=kube-system
        - --dns01-recursive-nameservers-only
        - --dns01-recursive-nameservers="195.242.131.6:53"
```
2. Restart Cert Manager `kubectl -n cert-manager rollout restart deployment cert-manager` and wait a few minutes for it to restart and be ready.

### Fix correctly


1. Since you have the YAML for your Issuer/ClusterIssuer and secret for the DNS Services account, then uninstall first this webhook and then cert-manager:

1. Change to the deploy/ directory in this repo and uninstall this webhook
```shell
helm uninstall dns-services-webhook --namespace cert-manager
```
2. Uninstall Cert Manager 
```shell
helm uninstall cert-manager --namespace=cert-manager
```
3. Re-install Cert Manager but add the extraArgs to the installation 
```shell
helm install \
  cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --version v1.9.1 
  --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-recursive-nameservers-only,--dns01-recursive-nameservers=195.242.131.6:53}'
```
1. Re-install this webhook as described above and apply your Issuer/ClusterIssuer configurations and you should be good to go for later Helm upgrades of Cert Manager.


# Forking and developing etc.

You are always welcome to create a ticket/issue if you have issues, but please do check that the issue is not
* your Certificate configuration
* your ClusterIssuer configuration
* your Issuer configuration
* a well know [Cert Manager issue](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues)

Also if you fork the repo then please do so :-)

## A note on running the test suite

As per https://github.com/cert-manager/webhook-example then please do make sure that any pull-request you make works...

1. Make a copy of the config.json.sample file `cp testdata/dns-services/config.json.sample testdata/dns-services/config.json`
2. Make a copy of the dns-service.yaml.sample file `cp testdata/dns-services/dns-services.yaml.sample testdata/dns-services/dns-services.yaml`
3. Update the `dns-service.yaml` **using the base64** version of your username and password for https://DNS.Services (no TOTP needed).
4. Run the test 
```shell
TEST_ZONE_NAME=example.com. make test
```

Due to limits in the API in regards to amount of logins per time then do not run the test too many times in a row or when setting up new certificates (TLS configuartions in your Ingress/Gateway's). I would guestimate 1-3 certificates per 5min would be the limit - but just in case your certificate is not created, then delete the TLS entry in your Ingress/Gateway, wait 5-10min and add it again.
